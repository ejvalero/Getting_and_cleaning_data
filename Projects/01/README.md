Basics
-------------------------------

In this location you'll find the following:

- **run_analysis.R**: is the script that manages the data sets. It contains two functions, ```preprocessing()``` and ```tidy()```, which merges training and testing data sets, estracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each one, and creates a final tidy data set with the average of each variable by activity and subject.
Both ``preprocessing()``` and ```tidy()``` functions have comments throughout their codes, which indicate what each group of lines do.

- **average.txt**: is the output of tidy() function inside run_analysis.R.
