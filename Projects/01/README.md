Basics

In this location you'll find the following:

- **run_analysis.R**: is the script that handles the raw data sets. It contains two functions, ```preprocessing()``` and ```tidy()```, which merges training and testing data sets, estracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each one, and creates a final tidy data set with the average of each variable by activity and subject.
Both ```preprocessing()``` and ```tidy()``` functions have comments throughout their codes, indicating what each group of lines do.

- **average.txt**: is the final data set which is automatically generated by running ```run_analysis.R``` script.

Instructions to use ```run_analysis.R```
_______________________________

Just put ```run_analysis.R``` script inside the same location of *UCI HAR Dataset* directory and run it as follow:

```
source("run_analysis.R")
```
